# Deploy to Railway with PostgreSQL

Complete guide to deploying Drama Tracker on Railway.app with managed PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Code pushed to GitHub repository
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create Railway Account

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

### 2. Create New Project

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose `drama-tracker` from your repositories
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Next.js app

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

Railway provides managed PostgreSQL:

1. In your project, click "New"
2. Select "Database"
3. Choose "Add PostgreSQL"
4. Railway will create a PostgreSQL instance

### 4. Link Database to Service

Railway automatically sets the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:

1. Click on your web service
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set (Railway does this automatically)
4. Add `NODE_ENV=production`

**Note:** Railway automatically connects your service to the PostgreSQL database!

### 5. Configure Build Settings (Auto-detected)

Railway should auto-detect these, but verify in Settings:

- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Start Command:** `npm start`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`

### 6. First Deploy - Seed the Database

After the first deployment succeeds:

1. Go to your service
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. You can run the seed command via Railway CLI (optional):
   ```bash
   railway run npm run db:seed
   ```

Or just log in and add data through the UI!

### 7. Deploy!

1. Click "Deploy" or push to GitHub
2. Railway will:
   - Pull your code
   - Install dependencies
   - Run build
   - Initialize database
   - Start the app

Watch the logs in the "Deployments" tab.

### 8. Get Your URL

1. Click "Settings"
2. Scroll to "Networking"
3. Click "Generate Domain"
4. Railway gives you a URL like: `drama-tracker-production.up.railway.app`

### 9. First Login

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Login as "Lowri"
3. Go to "Manage Friends" â†’ Set password for Lowri
4. Done! ðŸŽ‰

## Environment Variables Explained

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Tells Next.js to run in production mode |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://...` | Auto-set by Railway, points to PostgreSQL database |

## Database Management on Railway

### View Database

Railway provides multiple ways to access your PostgreSQL database:

1. **Railway Dashboard:**
   - Click on PostgreSQL service
   - Go to "Data" tab
   - Browse tables directly

2. **psql CLI:**
   ```bash
   railway connect postgres
   ```

3. **Prisma Studio (local):**
   ```bash
   # Copy DATABASE_URL from Railway
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." npx prisma studio
   ```

### Backup Database

Railway automatically backs up your PostgreSQL database!

**Manual backup:**
```bash
# Using Railway CLI
railway connect postgres
pg_dump > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### Reset Database

**Warning:** This will delete all data!

```bash
railway connect postgres
# Then in psql:
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
\q

# Run migrations again
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
railway run npm run db:seed
```

## Updating Your App

Railway auto-deploys on every push to GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature X"
git push

# Railway automatically detects the push and redeploys
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails

**Check the logs:**
- Go to Deployments â†’ Click on failed deployment â†’ View logs

**Common issues:**
- Missing dependencies: `npm install` in logs
- TypeScript errors: Fix and push again
- Environment variables: Double-check Variables tab

### Database errors

**"Can't connect to database":**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
- Check that services are linked (DATABASE_URL should be auto-set)
- Look for migration errors in deployment logs

**"Table does not exist":**
- Migrations may not have run
- Check deployment logs for `prisma migrate deploy` output
- Manually run: `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy`

### App starts but crashes

**Check logs:**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard
Deployments â†’ Latest â†’ View Logs
```

**Common causes:**
- Database not initialized: Run setup command
- Missing environment variables
- Port conflict (Railway auto-assigns PORT)

### Can't login

**Reset admin password:**
Unfortunately, you'll need to reset the database or manually update via downloaded DB.

## Cost Management

### Free Tier ($5/month credit)

Railway gives you $5 free credit every month:
- Enough for small apps with light usage
- ~500 hours of runtime
- No credit card required initially

### Monitor Usage

1. Go to your project
2. Click "Usage" tab
3. See current month's usage
4. Set up billing alerts

### Optimize Costs

- **Scale to zero when not in use:**
  - Settings â†’ Scale â†’ 0 replicas when idle

- **Reduce instance size:**
  - Most apps work fine on smallest instance

- **Monitor database size:**
  - Large databases cost more storage

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain

1. Settings â†’ Networking
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Add your domain: `dramatracker.com`
4. Update DNS with Railway's records

### Add HTTPS (Automatic)

Railway automatically provides SSL for:
- Railway domains (*.up.railway.app)
- Custom domains

No configuration needed!

### Environment-based Deploys

Create multiple services for staging/production:

1. New Service â†’ Connect same repo
2. Different branch (e.g., `staging`)
3. Different environment variables

## Monitoring

### View Logs

Real-time logs:
1. Your service â†’ "Observability"
2. View live logs as they come in

### Metrics

Railway provides basic metrics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Network traffic

## Railway CLI (Optional)

Install for local development:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
railway link

# Run locally with Railway env vars
railway run npm run dev

# Deploy from CLI
railway up
```

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. âœ… Test all features
2. âœ… Set passwords for all friends
3. âœ… Add some drama to test
4. âœ… Check statistics page
5. âœ… Set up custom domain (optional)
6. âœ… Configure backups

## Migration from Railway

If you ever want to migrate:

1. Export database:
   ```bash
   railway connect postgres
   pg_dump > export.sql
   ```

2. Import to new PostgreSQL instance:
   ```bash
   psql -h newhost -U user -d database < export.sql
   ```

3. Update `DATABASE_URL` in your new environment

Your code is platform-agnostic and works with any PostgreSQL database!
